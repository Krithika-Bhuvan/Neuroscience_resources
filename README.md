# Neuroscience resources
Curated Neuroscience related resources for open data science


## General purpose brain imaging repositories related to neuroscience
* OpenNeuro: https://openneuro.org/ is a resource for sharing of neuroscience data
* Neuroimaging Informatics Tools and Resources Clearinghouse Image Repository (NITRC): https://www.nitrc.org/. Has comprehensive information on an ever expanding scope of neuroinformatics software and data.
* The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) , focused on cancer but includes brain cancer datasets TCGA-GBM (Glioblastoma), TCGA-LGG (Lower Grade Glioma), Rembrandt: https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/
* Imaging data commons (IDC), focused on cancer but incluces brain cancer datasets. Have option to connect tools to the data via a google cloud platform

  - PRIDE (PRoteomics IDEntifications), the leading proteomics data repository, has only three SCZ-related data sets: two in rat models and one in a mouse model.
* Metabolomics
  - EBI’s Metabolights and NCBI’s Metabolomics Workbench (MW) are two major metabolomics data repositories
* Imaging repositories
  - SchizConnect is a federated portal that integrates data from three neuroimaging consortia on SCZ: FBIRN's Human Imaging Database (HID), MRN's Collaborative Imaging and Neuroinformatics System (COINS) and the Northwestern University Schizophrenia Data and Software Tool (NUSDAST) project
